    <h5>Learn about Devops Security....</h5>
    <br>
    <p>As software applications grow in codebase scale and complexity, so do the surface areas for security
        vulnerabilities and exploits. And, as more organizations adopt a DevOps approach, which automates and integrates
        the processes between software development and IT teams, security as a “bolt-on” no longer works. Instead, teams
        need to embed security measures into every stage of the development workflow.

        <br><br>
        The term “DevSecOps” refers to integrating security throughout the DevOps lifecycle, and ensures security is
        built into the product, instead of applied to a finished product. To do this, organizations must ensure the
        entire DevOps team, including developers and operations teams, share responsibility for following security best
        practices. They should also enable automated security checks at each stage of software delivery by integrating
        security controls, tools, and processes into the DevOps workflow.
